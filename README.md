# Sales-Data-Exploration-SQL  

The data used is US regional sales data. It was gotten from kaggle.  

The data contains 6 tables: customer, location, product, region, sales order, and sales team.

I demonstrated my Data cleaning and Data analysis skills by providing answers to the following questions using SQL and MySQL workbench:

1. What is the total number of transactions made, total quantity of products ordered, total revenue and total profit?
2. What is the total number of transactions made, total quantity of products ordered, total revenue and total profit per order date?
3. What is the total transaction per sales channel?
4. What is the total number of customers and sales teams?
5. What is the total number of transaction for each customer?
6. What is the total number of stores in each region?
7. What is the total number of states in each region?
8. What is the total transaction per location type?
9. What is the total revenue and profit in each region?
10. What is the date difference between the order date and the delivery date?
11. How did each sales team perform based on the total transaction, total quantity sold and revenue made?
12. What are the most expensive and least expensive products ordered by customers?
13. How can I view the transaction details of any sales team by just entering their name?

I learnt three new functions through this project:
1. STR_TO_DATE()
2. DATEDIFF() and
3. Stored procedures

Your feedback is appreciated.

Warm regards,
